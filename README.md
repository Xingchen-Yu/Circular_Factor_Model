# Circular Factor Model
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/271097395.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/271097395)
## Data

Roll call data for the U.S. House of Representatives (100th  to 116th) is obtained from voteview.com.  Each data is binary and contains some missing values. 

## Code
Circular_Factor_Model.R takes 4 arguments which are iterations, burn-in period of mcmc, number of cores used, the number of the U.S
House of representatives data. It is recommended to run on a server with many cores.

For exammple, to run 100000 iterations with 80000 burn-in using 12 cores for the 112th U.S House of representative data,
one could excute the following command.

Rscript ./main_script/Circular_Factor_Model.R 100000 80000 12 112 &

## Reproducibility workflow
Under the root directory, first run each the following commands,

### Implement the circular factor model on 112 House data, with 100000 iterations, 80000 burn-in and 12 cores (2-3 days)

Rscript ./main_script/Circular_Factor_Model.R 100000 80000 12 112 &

### Implement the circular factor model on 116 House data, with 100000 iterations, 80000 burn-in and 12 cores (1-2 days)

Rscript ./main_script/Circular_Factor_Model.R 100000 80000 12 116 &

### Implement the 1d Euclidean latent factor model on 112 House data with 30000 iterations and 10000 burnin

Rscript ./main_script/Euclidean_1d.R 30000 10000 112 &

### Implement the 1d Euclidean latent factor model on 116 House with 30000 iterations and 10000 burnin

Rscript ./main_script/Euclidean_1d.R 30000 10000 116 &

### Implement the 2d Euclidean latent factor model on 116 House with 40000 iterations and 20000 burnin

Rscript ./main_script/Euclidean_2d.R 40000 20000 116 &

There will be a total of 7 Rdata files stored in the same directory. Tables 1, 2, 3 and Figures 3, 4, 5 can then be generated by running the tables_figures.R script.
